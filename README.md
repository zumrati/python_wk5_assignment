# python_wk5_assignment
This project is a simple demonstration of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using Python. It includes:

- A custom `Superhero` class with inheritance.
- Encapsulation through protected attributes.
- Polymorphism using method overriding in both a superhero context and a vehicle simulation.

## 📁 Contents

1. `superhero.py` – Contains the `Superhero` and `FlyingSuperhero` classes with attributes, methods, and inheritance.
2. `vehicles.py` – Demonstrates polymorphism with different types of vehicles.
3. `README.md` – Project overview and instructions.

## 🚀 Features

### Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class
- **Class:** `Superhero`
- **Attributes:** name, power, city
- **Methods:** `introduce()`, `use_power()`
- **Inheritance:** `FlyingSuperhero` subclass with additional method `fly()` and overridden `use_power()`

### Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge
- **Base Class:** `Vehicle`
- **Subclasses:** `Car`, `Plane`, `Boat`
- Each subclass defines its own version of the `move()` method.
